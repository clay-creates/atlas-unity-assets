# Database Manager Unity Package

**Database Manager** is a Unity package designed to simplify managing in-game items like weapons, armor, and potions. With an intuitive editor window and CSV import/export functionality, it streamlines the process of adding, editing, and organizing your game assets. This tool is ideal for RPGs, adventure games, or any project where managing complex item databases is essential.

## Project Story

The Database Manager package was developed to address a recurring need in game development: managing diverse and expanding item databases without repetitive manual entry. During development, I focused on building a system that allows for quick, bulk editing of items while retaining flexibility. By combining custom editor windows with CSV import/export, I aimed to make it accessible to designers and developers alike. The result is a comprehensive package that enhances productivity, allowing teams to focus more on gameplay and less on tedious data management.

## Features

- **In-Editor Item Management**: Add, edit, and delete weapons, armor, and potions directly in Unity, with a streamlined editor interface.
- **CSV Import/Export**: Easily import and export item data using CSV files, allowing for quick, bulk edits outside of Unity.
- **Search and Filter**: Quickly find items by type or name, making it easy to locate and edit specific entries in large databases.
- **Modular Design**: Built with extensibility in mind, making it easy to adapt for additional item types or categories.

### Future Development
- **Item Categorization**: Additional filters and categories for organizing items by rarity, value, or other attributes.
- **Batch Operations**: Adding support for batch editing to modify multiple items simultaneously.
- **Enhanced CSV Import Options**: Configurable settings for handling duplicate entries, mismatched fields, and validation.
